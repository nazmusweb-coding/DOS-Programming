You should know:
- D_ prefix is used for Diploma Holder functions.

void on_submit_button_clicked(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
- Handles the 'submit' button click event in a GTK application.
- Retrieves text from SSC and HSC entry widgets and the selected department from a combo box.
- Checks if any of the required fields are empty and displays a message if so.
- Converts the retrieved text to float values for SSC and HSC results.
- Initializes an Undergraduate struct with pointers to department-specific functions.
- Calls the appropriate function based on the selected department, 
  passing SSC and HSC results along with a callback function to display results.
- Frees memory allocated by GTK for the selected department string.

NOTE: This function is crucial for processing user input and ensuring that all required 
      fields are filled before proceeding with department-specific calculations or actions.

void D_on_submit_button_clicked(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
- Serves as a callback for the 'submit' button in the diploma interface of a GTK application.
- Retrieves text from the diploma entry widget and the selected department from a combo box.
- Checks if any of the required fields are empty and displays a message if so.
- Converts the retrieved text to a float value for the diploma result.
- Initializes an `UndergraduateDiploma` struct with pointers to department-specific functions for diploma holders.
- Calls the appropriate function based on the selected department, 
   passing the diploma result along with a callback function to display results.
- Frees memory allocated by GTK for the selected department string.

NOTE: This function is essential for processing diploma holder input and ensuring that all required 
      fields are filled before proceeding with department-specific calculations or actions.

void display_result(const char *message)
- This function is responsible for displaying results in a GTK text buffer.
- It retrieves the end iterator of the text buffer to ensure that new text is appended at the end.
- Inserts the provided message into the text buffer at the end position.
- Implementing this function was the reason to declare ResultCallback function pointer earlier in the header  file.

NOTE: The `display_result` function is a utility function used throughout the GTK application to output 
      messages to both the user interface and the console, aiding in both user interaction and debugging.
