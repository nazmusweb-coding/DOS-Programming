You should know:
- D_ prefix is used for Diploma Holder functions.

void on_submit_button_clicked(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
- Handles the 'submit' button click event in a GTK application.
- Retrieves text from SSC and HSC entry widgets and the selected department from a combo box.
- Checks if any of the required fields are empty and displays a message if so.
- Converts the retrieved text to float values for SSC and HSC results.
- Initializes an Undergraduate struct with pointers to department-specific functions.
- Calls the appropriate function based on the selected department, 
  passing SSC and HSC results along with a callback function to display results.
- Frees memory allocated by GTK for the selected department string.

NOTE: This function is crucial for processing user input and ensuring that all required 
      fields are filled before proceeding with department-specific calculations or actions.

void D_on_submit_button_clicked(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
- Serves as a callback for the 'submit' button in the diploma interface of a GTK application.
- Retrieves text from the diploma entry widget and the selected department from a combo box.
- Checks if any of the required fields are empty and displays a message if so.
- Converts the retrieved text to a float value for the diploma result.
- Initializes an `UndergraduateDiploma` struct with pointers to department-specific functions for diploma holders.
- Calls the appropriate function based on the selected department, 
   passing the diploma result along with a callback function to display results.
- Frees memory allocated by GTK for the selected department string.

NOTE: This function is essential for processing diploma holder input and ensuring that all required 
      fields are filled before proceeding with department-specific calculations or actions.

void display_result(const char *message)
- This function is responsible for displaying results in a GTK text buffer.
- It retrieves the end iterator of the text buffer to ensure that new text is appended at the end.
- Inserts the provided message into the text buffer at the end position.
- Implementing this function was the reason to declare ResultCallback function pointer earlier in the header  file.

NOTE: The `display_result` function is a utility function used throughout the GTK application to output 
      messages to both the user interface and the console, aiding in both user interaction and debugging.

void show_undergraduate(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
- This callback function is triggered to show the undergraduate interface.
- It first clears any previous content in the container using `gtk_container_foreach` and `gtk_widget_destroy`.
- Then, it calls `create_undergraduate_interface` to build the undergraduate interface inside the content area.
- Finally, it refreshes the container to display the new interface with `gtk_widget_show_all`.

void show_diploma(GtkWidget *widget, gpointer data)
- Similar to `show_undergraduate`, this callback function is used to show the diploma interface.
- It clears any existing content in the container.
- Calls `create_diploma_interface` to construct the diploma interface within the content area.
- Refreshes the container to update the display with the new interface.

NOTE: Both functions are essential for switching between different user interfaces within the application, 
      ensuring a smooth transition and clear display of the relevant interface based on user selection.

void create_undergraduate_interface(GtkWidget *container)
- This function constructs the undergraduate interface within a given container widget.
- It creates a new grid widget to organize interface elements.
- Adds labels and entry widgets for SSC and HSC results, allowing users to input their scores.
- Sets up a combo box for department selection with various options like BBA, LLB, EEE, etc.
- Includes a 'Submit' button that triggers the `on_submit_button_clicked` callback when clicked.
- Initializes a text view and its associated buffer for displaying results, making it non-editable and hiding the cursor.

NOTE: The `create_undergraduate_interface` function is crucial for setting up the user interface where undergraduate applicants 
      can enter their results and select their desired department for further processing or evaluation in the application.

void create_diploma_interface(GtkWidget *container)
- This function is designed to construct the diploma interface within a specified container widget.
- It creates a grid layout to organize interface elements systematically.
- Adds a label and an entry widget for the diploma result, allowing diploma holders to input their score.
- Sets up a combo box for department selection with options like EEE, Textile, CSE, etc.
- Includes a 'Submit' button that connects to the `D_on_submit_button_clicked` callback for processing the input when clicked.
- Initializes a text view and its associated buffer for result display, configured to be non-editable and with an invisible cursor.

NOTE: The `create_diploma_interface` function plays a key role in providing a user interface for diploma holders to 
      enter their results and choose their department for subsequent actions or calculations in the application.

GtkWidget *content_area;
- This global widget serves as the main container for the content in the application. 
  It is where different interfaces are loaded and displayed.

GtkWidget *ssc_entry, *hsc_entry;
- These global entry widgets are used for inputting SSC (Secondary School Certificate) and HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate) results
  in the undergraduate interface.

GtkWidget *department_combo;
- This global combo box widget allows users to select a department from a list of options in both undergraduate and diploma interfaces.

GtkWidget *result_view;
- This global text view widget is used to display results or messages back to the user. It is set to be non-editable.

GtkTextBuffer *result_buffer;
- Associated with `result_view`, this global buffer stores the text displayed in the text view widget.

GtkWidget *diploma_entry;
- Similar to `ssc_entry` and `hsc_entry`, this global entry widget is used for inputting diploma results in the diploma interface.

int main(int argc, char **argv)
- This function is the entry point of the GTK application.
- Initializes GTK with `gtk_init`.
- Creates the main window with a title "NUB Admission Costing Calculator" and sets 
  its properties like border width, default size, position, and resizability.
- Sets up a grid layout as the main container for the window's content.
- Constructs a menu bar with menu items "Undergraduate" and "Undergraduate (for Diploma Holders)" 
  which are connected to their respective callback functions to display different interfaces.
- Initializes the `content_area` as a vertical box to hold different interfaces and attaches it to the grid.
- Calls `create_undergraduate_interface` to load the undergraduate interface by default.
- Shows all widgets with `gtk_widget_show_all`.
- Connects the window's destroy event to end the GTK main loop, allowing for clean exit of the application.
- Enters GTK main loop with `gtk_main`.

NOTE: The `main` function sets up the initial state of the application, including window properties, menu options, 
      and default interface. It also handles event connections for user interactions and application lifecycle.
