You should know:
- D_ prefix is used for Diploma Holder functions.

void replace_placeholder(char *buffer, const char *placeholder, const char *value)
- At first, finds placeholder position 
- Then adds null character at starting position of placeholder.
- Concatenates temp, buffer, value together originally inside of temp.
- Lastly and safely, temp is copied in actual buffer.

NOTE: here temp is used for avoiding overlapping issues, safe replacement, buffer overflow protection.

void Display(ResultCallback callback)
- Opens "formats/format.txt" in read mode.
- Opens a temporary file defined by TEMP_FILE_NAME for read and write operations.
- Reads lines from the format file into a buffer.
- For each placeholder found, replaces it with its corresponding value using the replace_placeholder function.
- Writes the updated buffer to the temporary file.
- Rewinds the temporary file to read from the beginning.
- Reads lines from the temporary file and calls the provided callback function with each line of output.
- Closes both input and temporary files.
- Removes the temporary file using TEMP_FILE_NAME.

NOTE: The use of a temporary file ensures that data is processed and stored safely before being passed
      to the callback, preventing potential data corruption or loss during processing.

void D_Display(ResultCallback callback)
- Opens "formats/D_format.txt" as read mode.
- Opens a temporary file defined by TEMP_FILE_NAME for read and write operations.
- Reads lines from the D_format file into a buffer.
- For each placeholder found, replaces it with its corresponding value using the replace_placeholder function.
- Writes the updated buffer to the temporary file.
- Rewinds the temporary file to read from the beginning.
- Reads lines from the temporary file and calls the provided callback function with each line of output.
- Closes both input and temporary files.
- Removes the temporary file using TEMP_FILE_NAME.

NOTE: This function is similar to `Display` but uses a different format file ("formats/D_format.txt").
      It ensures safe data processing and storage before passing it to the callback, avoiding data 
      corruption or loss during processing.
