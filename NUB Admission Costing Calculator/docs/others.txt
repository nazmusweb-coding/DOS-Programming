${PROG}: ${PROG}.c
	${CC} ${PROG}.c ${OPTION1}.c -o ${PROG} ${CFLAGSANDLIBS}
- This rule compiles the main program. It uses `gcc` to compile `main.c` and `test.c` into an executable named `main`.
- It includes flags and libraries for GTK+ 3.0, retrieved using `pkg-config`, and links the math library with `-lm`.
- Executing `make` will dynamically link everything and compile the programs to generate a executable file named `main`

clean:
    rm ${PROG}
- This rule is a phony target that doesn't represent a file. It's used to clean up the directory by removing the compiled executable `main`.
- Executing `make clean` will delete the `main` file, allowing for a fresh build next time `make` is run.
